      The <strong>Roman Republic</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a>: <i lang="la">Res publica Romana</i>, <code>Classical Latin</code>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin">[ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na]</a>) was the era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">classical Roman civilization</a> beginning with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Roman_monarchy">overthrow</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom">Roman Kingdom</a>, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">city's</a> immediate surroundings to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony">hegemony</a> over the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean world</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman government in the early Republic was dominated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrician_(ancient_Rome)">patricians</a>, a wealthy, landowning minority who traced their ancestry to Rome's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome">foundation</a>, and had overthrown its monarchy. They shared the former powers of the kings among themselves, in the form of annually elected magistracies, senior military posts, and influential priesthoods. Republican government was headed by two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul">consuls</a>, advised by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate">senate</a> of magistrates and ex-magistrates. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class_in_ancient_Rome">Social class and status</a> determined a citizen's voting rights, the value of his vote, and his lawful capacity for high civil, military and religious office; a patrician's vote far outweighed that of a citizen-commoner (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebs">pleb</a>); this led to conflicts between the patrician minority and the far more numerous plebs. A series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Constitution_of_the_Roman_Republic">constitutional reforms</a> recognised wealthy, leading plebeian families as a legitimate aristocracy, and their most distinguished, reputable men as eligible for the highest elected offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Republican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mos_maiorum">tradition and morality</a> fostered competition for office and personal honours in service of the Republic. Among the elite, military service was a prerequisite to a career in politics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome">Patronage</a> was an essential feature of Rome's economy and social structure. Republican conservatives and traditionalists were wary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue">demagogues</a>; appeals to the plebs for direct political support could be interpreted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant">tyranny</a>, and subversion of established order. The aristocratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi">Gracchi</a> brothers introduced land reforms on behalf of landless plebs, and were murdered by their opponents.

    <p>
    During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Italy">central Italy</a> to the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Peninsula">Italian peninsula</a>. By the following century, it included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa">North Africa</a>, most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, and what is now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France">southern France</a>. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France">modern France</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece">Greece</a>, and much of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean">eastern Mediterranean</a>. Factional tensions led to a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_civil_wars_and_revolts">civil wars</a>, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius Caesar's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Civil_War#Crossing_the_Rubicon">crossing of the Rubicon River</a>, his appointment as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dictator">dictator for life</a> and assassination in 44, the defeat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium">Battle of Actium</a> in 31 BC, and the Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Octavian</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_(title)">Augustus</a> in 27 BC, effectively making him the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor">Roman emperor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Roman_Empire">ending the Republic</a>.
