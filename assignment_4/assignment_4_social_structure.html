        Citizen families were headed by the family's oldest male, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_familias">pater familias</a>, who was lawfully entitled to exercise complete authority (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_familias">patria potestas</a>) over family property and all family members. Brutus, co-founder of the Republic, is supposed to have exercised the extreme form of this right when he executed his own sons for treachery. Citizenship offered legal protection and rights, but citizens who offended Rome's traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mos_maiorum">moral code</a> could be declared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamia">infamous</a>, and lose certain legal and social privileges. Citizenship was also taxable, and undischarged debt was potentially a capital offence. A form of limited, theoretically voluntary slavery (debt bondage, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexum">nexum</a>) allowed wealthy creditors to negotiate payment of debt through bonded service. Poor, landless citizens of the lowest class (proletarii) might contract their sons to a creditor, patron or third party employer to obtain an income, or to pay off family debts. Nexum was only abolished when slave labour became more readily available, most notably during the Punic wars.

        Slaves were simultaneously family members and family property. They could be bought, sold, acquired through warfare, or born and raised within their master's household. They could also buy their freedom with money saved or the offer of future services as a freedman or woman, and their sons could be eligible for citizenship; this degree of social mobility was unusual in the ancient world. Freed slaves and the master who freed them retained certain legal and moral mutual obligations. This was the bottom rung of one of Rome's fundamental social and economic institutions, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome">client-patron relationship</a>. At the top rung were the senatorial families of the landowning nobility, both patrician and plebeian, bound by shifting allegiances and mutual competition. A plebiscite of 218 forbade senators and their sons to engage in substantial trade or money-lending. A wealthy equestrian class emerged, not subject to the same trading constraints as the senate.

        Citizen men and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Rome">citizen women</a> were expected to marry, produce as many children as possible, and improve - or at worst, conserve - their family's wealth, fortune, and public profile. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Rome">Marriage</a> offered opportunities for political alliance and social advancement. Patricians usually married in a form known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confarreatio">confarreatio</a>, which transferred the bride from her father's absolute control or "hand" (manus) to that of her husband. Patrician status could only be inherited through birth; an early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tables">law</a>, introduced by the reactionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decemviri">Decemviri</a> but rescinded in 445, sought to prevent marriages between patricians and plebeians; any resulting offspring may not have been legally recognised. Among ordinary plebeians, different marriage forms offered married women considerable more freedom than their patrician counterparts, until manus marriage was replaced by free marriage, in which the wife remained under the legal authority of her absent father, not her husband. Infant mortality was high. Towards the end of the Republic, the birthrate began to fall among the elite. Some wealthy, childless citizens resorted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome">adoption</a> to provide male heirs for their estates, and to forge political alliances. Adoption was subject to the senate's approval; the notoriously unconventional patrician politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher">Publius Clodius Pulcher</a> had himself and his family adopted into a plebeian clan, so that he could hold a plebeian tribunate.
